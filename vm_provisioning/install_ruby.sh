# ATTENTION:
#   * This script is run as the ubuntu USER because installing RVM as root would
#   cause all sorts of problems.
#   * DO NOT prefix with "sudo" any commands related to RVM, Ruby or gem
#   installation. Only use sudo for apt-get and other "root only" commands.

# This script receives the following environment variables from the Vagrantfile
# Has to be exported or else the "source" command below makes it unaccessible
