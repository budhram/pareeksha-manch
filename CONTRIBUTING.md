## How to contribute to Pareeksha Manch

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/shikshaplus/pareeksha-manch/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/shikshaplus/pareeksha-manch/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to Ruby on Rails](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks. We expect you to follow these guidelines while coding as well.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial value to the stability, functionality, or testability of the project will generally not be accepted :wink:.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

Open a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/shikshaplus/pareeksha-manch/issues/new) with relevant information related to feature or change. We hope you provide most of the information during issue creation :smile:.


#### *Pareeksha Manch is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to pitch in and join the [team](https://github.com/shikshaplus/pareeksha-manch/graphs/contributors). Hope you will join us in this endeavor.*
